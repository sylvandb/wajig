Use /var/log/dpkg.log for the log, not own log?

Idea from Dirk 13 Nov 2004

wajig restore 041129

      This will purge all packages currently installed but not listed
      in the named snapshot, and perhaps it also installs any packages
      listed in the snapshot but not currently installed?

Not sure about restoring specific versions.  Would be possible from the 
Japanesse archive I think.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rewrite!!!!  The code has evolved to a state where it would be best to
redesign it properly, object-oriented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the following commands:

 upgrade-version 4.3.0.dfsg.1-6 4.3.0.dfsg.1-8

	Suggested by David Liontooth

	This would upgrade every package at the first version level to 
	that of the second version. Something like:

	wajig status | grep 4.3.0.dfsg.1-6 | grep 4.3.0.dfsg.1-8 |
	cut -f1 | xargs wajig install

Possibly begin using grep-dctrl.

GJig

	Reconfigure (and Settings -> Gnome/...)
	TaskSel
	Local Dist Upgrade
	Move
	List Cache

	How to make "Help -> Basics" as default action instead of Update!
	In Help -> Contents, go to canonincal Web page.
	Move full documentation out to the Web Page.

	Add gjig to Gnome Menu (Under System?)

	If command expects arguments then instead of error, give a text box
	to enter the arguments, then add it to the Packages text box.

   wajig toupgrade unstable

would show all packages that are newer in unstable, even if I have a
pin. Currently, I have to do

   sudo apt-get -t unstable dist-upgrade

then cancel the upgrade and install the packages I want.

Should there be an option where netselect-apt directly places the
results into /etc/apt/sources.list?
