Wajig is now a native Debian package.
See /usr/share/doc/wajig/changelog for NEWS.

wajig (2.0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * New command LISTSECTION and LISTSECTIONS.

wajig (2.0.21) 2005/02/01

    - Exit with status 1 if LISTNAMES returns no results. Bug reported by 
      A Costa (Closes: #292581).

wajig (2.0.20) 2005/01/29

    - Take over Debian maintenance from Dirk. Thanks for all your efforts
      Dirk!
    - Fix a locale problem where LC_ALL was being set to C by wajig for 
      all external system calls. Only needed for STATUS? Bug reported
      by Serge Matveev (Closes: #288852).
    - Fix bug in getting username when USER not define, reported by
      Dirk Eddelbuettel
    - Fix typo reported by A Costa (Closes: #292456)
    - LISTALTS should ignore the README Reported by A Costa 
      (Closes: #292457)
    - Fix change of DEPENDEES to DEPENDENTS Reported by A Costa 
      (Closes: #292469)

wajig (2.0.19) 2005/01/07

    - Fix problem when using sudo, and running wajig as root - if root
      was not in sudoers file then wajig could not run. root did not need
      to be in the sudoers file to run wajig - added a check for root 
      running wajig and if so, don't use sudo if sudo is installed.
      Bug reported by Serge Matveev (Closes: #288849).
    - Fix bug with PURGE-ORPHANS whereby sudo was being doubly used
      and causing problems if root was not in sudoers. Bug reported by
      Serge Matveev (Closes: #288847)
    - Continue work on command interpreter completion. Only command 
      complete the first "word" not all "words" in the command line.
    - REC-DOWNLOAD has been renamed RECURSIVE (but kept for
      compatibility)

wajig (2.0.18) 2005/01/03

    - Some simple documentation changes.
    - Without any arguments wajig will start a command interpreter.
      The command interpreter accepts any wajig command, with completion.
      Suggested by Lorenzo Prince (Closes: #288041).
    - Fix small bug in WHICHPKG which generated blank lines in output.

wajig (2.0.17) 2004/12/30

    - DETAILS now allows DEB files as arguments. Calls dpkg-deb --info.
    - CHANGELOG now tries harder to get most recent changelog. Rather
      than relying on http://changelogs.debian.net/<pkg>, use http://
      packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/..../<pkg>_<version>/changelog.
      Delay in the updating of changelogs.debian.net links pointed out
      by Matthew Hawkins (and Closes: #286580).

wajig (2.0.16) 2004/11/29

    - Add new command SNAPSHOT which prints each package installed and
      its version number in the "package=version" format. Saving this
      to file will allow a Debian system to be restored to just this
      collection of packages at some later stage with the RESTORE
      command (yet to be implemented). Suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel.
    - Update README command to report missing READMEs and missing doc
      directory. Suggested by Gintautas Miliauskas.
    - Remove remaining TABS from files to avoid mixing tabs and space.
      (Closes: #283335)

wajig (2.0.15) 2004/11/28

    - Move the main documentation out of wajig into the Survival Guide.
    - Improve README to show all documentation files found.
    - Add second argument completion for bash (Closes: #283307) 

Version 2.0.14 2004/11/16
  * Bug Fixes:
    - Handle pipes in sudo handled commands (each part of the pipe
      must be sudo). Bug pointed out by Dirk Eddelbuettel and particulary
      affected HOLD and UNHOLD when sudo was installed.

Version 2.0.13 2004/11/14
  * Bug Fixes:
    - Don't depend on sudo.  Wajig has always worked with just su.
    - Update documentation of DEPENDENTS - fixes Bug#280163
    - LARGE now sorts the list by the size of the package, and
      commifies the numbers. Sorting suggested by Gintautas Miliauskas
      in Bug#280486
    - HOLD/UNHOLD now work properly when `sudo' is not installed.
      Fixes Bug#280305 reported by Georg C. Kaindl.
    - Remove lengthy message when sudo is not installed - keep it brief
      and don't over-encourage people to use sudo since there are 
      security issues (around letting non-root passwords run commands
      as root).
    
  * New Commands:
    - README to cat the README file in /usr/share/doc. Suggested 
      by Gintautas Miliauskas in Bug#280486.
    - AUTO-ALTS to change alternatives back to autoconfigure. Suggested 
      by Gintautas Miliauskas in Bug#280486.

Version 2.0.12 2004/11/06

  * Bug Fixes:
    - The apt-setup command comes from base-config now, not apt-setup.
      Pointed out by Peter Funk.
    - Replace /etc/init.d with invoke-rc.d in wajig.py.
      Fixes Bug#276538 reported by Martin Krafft.
    - Incorporate patches from Dirk Eddelbuett:
      Makefile.in and src/Makefile.in: Use ${DESTDIR}
      wajig.sh.in and gjig.sh.in: Use -O
    - DEPENDEES becomes DEPENDENTS. Fixes Bug#277186 from Reuben Thomas.

Version 2.0.11 2004/08/09

  * Bug Fixes:
    - FORCE will now work if the package has not yet been downloaded.
      (Fixes Bug#252600 reported by Francesco Potorti)
    - CHANGELOG now handles source packages with different (but specified)
      version numbers. (Fixes Bug#248549 reported by Brad Sawatzky)
    - NEWS now handles source packages with different (but specified)
      version numbers. (Similar to Bug#248549)
    - NEWS requires the lynx package - note this if it is not installed.

Version 2.0.10 2004/05/23

  * New Commands:
    - FILE-REMOVE will remove all packages listed in file, as
      suggested by Solo Turn.
    - LIST-WIDE is the same as LIST but use a wider column to avoid
      truncated names (Reported by Karl Schmidt, Suggested by Dirk
      Eddelbuett).
    - LIST-STATUS is the same as LIST but will only list first two
      columns (desired/status and non-truncated package name). Fixes
      a problem reported by Solo Turn.

Version 2.0.9 2004/05/04

  * New command SEARCH-APT will search for well connected
    Debian archives.

  * Modify POLICY command to work without any arguments 
    to list the apt-get sources, as suggested by Sami
    Haahtinen (Fixes Bug#246931).

  * Add src/bash_completion.py to generate 
    wajig.completion for bash
    completion of wajig commands. Install into
    /etc/bash_completion.d/wajig. Users who want 
    to use this might have
    to add the following to their .bashrc:

    if [ "$PS1" -a -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
      . /etc/bash_completion
    fi

  * Wajig development has moved to wajig.sarovar.org. 
    Who would like to join the development team?

  * Reimplement STATUS-MATCH to use the internal 
    LIST-NAMES instead of apt-cache search. This now
    matches just on package names. Also check for 
    no matches and print a message if none found. 
    Fixes bugs reported by David Liontooth, 
    Bug#240403, Bug#240359.

  * On an update list the actual number of new 
    packages in addition to the change in the number 
    of packages available, as suggested by
    David Liontooth.

Version 2.0.8 2004/03/10

  * gjig: Add hostname to all windows to disambiguate gjig sessions on
    multiple hosts that might be managed with gjig. SUggested by Dirk
    Eddelbuett.

  * wajig: fix "grep" commands to use "--" in case "-" begins a pattern
    being searched for in, e.g., listnames. 

  * Allow "," to spearate arguments on the wajig command line! Makes
    it easier to cut-n-paste from package lists generated by various
    commands. Suggested by David Liontooth.

Version 2.0.7 2004/03/03

  * HOLD/UNHOLD now also list all held packages. This provides more
    informative output in GJIG.

  * New Commands:
    
    - TASKSEL to run gnome-tasksel - Thus gnome-tasksel is now a 
      suggested package.

  * Updated Commands:

    - LISTCACHE can take an optional argument to filter the output.

    - STATUS now handles g++ properly instead of interpreting the + as
      a regular expression character - use grep instead of egrep.

Version 2.0.6 2004/02/16

  * Install icons with py files for now - symlinks were a problem.

  * Rewrite gnome code. A little simpler and tidier.
    Move to using TextWidgets for read only output.
    Fix a few Gnome interface problems.
    Add the HOLD commands to the interface.
    Add a few more commands to the interface.

  * Spell check documentation!
    
  * Begin checking that appropriate packages are installed for specific
    commands, and if not, print a helpful message.

  * New Commands:

    - LIST-HOLD to list any packages that are on hold. Suggested by 
      Christian T. Steigies.

Version 2.0.5 2004/02/10

  * Fixes

Version 2.0.4 2004/02/09

  * Include a new Gnome GUI (gjig). This is a first cut at a GUI. 
    Suggestions for how it should look are welcome. Currently it is a
    simple matrix of buttons. Functional but not so pretty!

  * Also explain the name at last: A JIG is a: small machine or handy
    tool used to guide other tools; a quick dance, generally an
    old rustic dance involving kicking and leaping; a light,
    humorous piece of writing, especially in rhyme, a farce in verse, or a
    ballad. `Wa' is Japanese, indicating `harmony' and `team spirit and
    unity.'

  * Fixes:

    - FIX-MISSING was misspelt as FIX-MISING.
    - Remove sudo when running apt-cache - not needed!
    - For LISTNAMES if user can't access /etc/apt/sources.list then
      run apt-cache under sudo to get access.
    - Remove the EDIT command - doesn't seem like a good idea!

  * New Commands:
  
    - NON-FREE will list installed packages that do not meet the Debian
      Free Software Guidelines. (Requires the vrms package.)
    - AUTO-INSTALL to install without asking questions (--assume-yes)
    - --pause/-p to pause for user to press <Enter> after command is run.
      This is for use in gjig.
    - Replace EDIT-SOURCES with SETUP to edit the sources.list file.

Version 1.0.2 2003/10/27

* Fixes:
  
  Fix typo in documentation reported by Vadim Kutchin. (Fixes Bug#217411)

  Reimplement PURGE/DEPEND and REMOVE/DEPEND - no longer rely on
  aptitude (since it didn't work - only if you use aptitude to also
  install). Both commands now remove pkg plus any it requires/suggests
  which is not required by anything else. Bug reported by John V. Belmont
  (Fixes Bug#211211)

Version 1.0.1 2003/10/24

  * New Commands:
    - CHANGELOG to list the change log of a package. Useful to check
      to see if you want to install the package without downloading 
      it.
    - FINDPKG and UNOFFICIAL to search for an unofficial Debian 
      package at apt-get.org.
    - SHOW-INSTALL and SHOW-REMOVE to list the steps that would be taken
      for the install or removal. Also document SHOW-UPGRADE and 
      SHOW-DIST-UPGRADE which had been overlooked. Fixes Bug#215835.

Version 1.0.0 2003/10/01

Finally move to version 1 - seems pretty robust now (and perhaps has
been for quite a while).

* Fixes:

  NEWS now checks for the Source package name and uses that if it exists.
  Reported by John Belmonte. Fixes Bug#211130

* New Commands

  INSTALL/DIST will choose the distribution DIST (e.g., unstable) for 
  installing packages from. Idea from John Belmonte and Dirk
  Eddelbuettel. Fixes Bug#209385

  (As a consequnce "/" is added as an additional meta character that
  wajig ignores in the command name, together with "_" and "-".)

  UPGRADE/SECURITY will do an upgrade of any (and only) packages with
  security fixes. Suggested by Markus Hegland.

* Todo:

  REMOVE-DEPEND uses "aptitude" but only works for packages installed
  with "aptitude". Instead, if we "REMOVE-DEPEND A" and A depends on B
  then remove B if there are no other installed packages that
  depend on B. Repeat recursively.

Version 0.3.30 2003/09/13

* Fixes:
  WHICHPKG did not handle diversions - now fixed.
  Reported by Chris Stork.  Fixes Bug#210499.

Version 0.3.29 2003/09/10

* Fixes:
  NEWS does not translate HTML escapes. Use lynx to map all.
  (John Belmonte)(closes Bug#208632)

* New commands:
  PURGE-DEPEND purges a package and all those it "Requires" but which 
  are not "Required" by other packages (suggested by John Belmonte).
  (closes Bug#209383).

Version 0.3.28 2003/09/09

* New commands:
  UNHOLD reverses the effect of a HOLD (Dirk Eddelbuettel)

* Fixes:
  NEWS does not translate HTML escapes. Fix to handle &lt; and &gt;.
  (John Belmonte)
  DEPENDEES - don't use grep-dctrl anymore - giving line error.

Version 0.3.26 2003/08/23

* Fixes
  Don't store the Packages file (11MB) that we started using in
  0.2.24. Instead create as required as a pipe interally.

* Updates
  We no longer cache the Installed file. The Available file will
  also disappear soon. Instead, simply generate them as required 
  - this is reasonably quick. This saves 40K + 280K.

Version 0.3.25 2003/08/22

* New commands:
  RECDOWNLOAD recursive download of a package and its dependencies
  Thanks to Juanjo Alvarez <juanjux@yahoo.es>

Version 0.3.24 2003/07/11

* Fixes
  The apt-get/deselect list of available packages does not seem to be
  getting updated on a wajig update. Fix for now by saving the output
  of apt-cache dump-avail into ~/.wajig and use that.

* New commands:
  SIZE/SIZES list sizes of installed packages.
  LARGE lists size of large packages installed.

Version 0.3.23 2003/05/18

* Bug Fixes:
  The Available file used to have an additional space on each line
    which could be wasting some 10K depending on distribution.  Removed!
    Reported by Dan Jacobson, bug #192861.
  LAST-UPDATE assumes the Available file already exists.  Simply
    ignore if not. Reported by Dan Jacobson, bug #192862

* New commands:
  AVAIL is a synonym for AVAILABLE
  NEWS obtains the latest news about the package from ackages.qa.debian.org
  REMOVE-DEPEND uses aptitude to do the remove, thus removing any other 
    packages that this package depends on and are not used by others.
    Requested by Jakub Turski, bug #192685

Version 0.3.22 2003/05/06

* Changed commands:
  DOWNLOAD: Force download even if package is installed.
	Suggested by Francesco Potorti

* New commands:
  LOCAL-UPGRADE and LOCAL-DIST-UPGRADE: Perform an upgrade using any
  packages already in the archive area, but don't try downloading
  any other packages.

Version 0.3.21 2003/05/06

* New commands:
  NEW-UPGRADE: Same as NEW-UPGRADES!
  PURGE-ORPHANS: Like REMOVE-ORPHANS but does a --purge
	Suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel

* Changed commands:
  REMOVE-ORPHANS: Do nothing if there are no orphans (previously gave error)
	Suggested by Eike Sauer

Version 0.3.20 2003/04/24

* Changed commands:
  PURGE: Uses dpkg rather than apt-get so that you can purge a removed pkg
	 Suggested by Francesco Potorti.

* New commands:
  Suggested by a request from Gordon Tyler:
  SHOW-DIST-UPGRADE: Show what packages would be upgraded.
  SHOW-UPGRADE: Show what packages would be upgraded.

* New command line options:
  -s: Simulate execution to see what commands would be run.
      Similar to -t but does not execuite the command.

Version 0.3.19 2003/04/04

* New commands:
  FIX-MISSING: Run apt-get --fix-missing upgrade

* Catch exceptions to avoid Python trace dumps.

Version 0.3.18 2003/03/22

* Changed commands:
  MOVE: Do a CLEAN after the MOVE to clear out the cache.
  REPACKAGE: Needs root permission (but didn't previously?).
  AUTO-DOWLOAD: Use -v to get output as the commands execute.

* New commands:
  PACKAGE: a synonym for REPACKAGE.

Version 0.3.17 2003/02/12

* Changed commands:
  AUTO-DOWNLOAD: Don't list http/ftp. 

Version 0.3.16 2003/02/12

* New commands:
  LIST-CACHE: List the contents of the download cache (Francis F. Steen)
  LIST-DAEMONS: List the daemons that wajig can stop/start/reload/restart
  FIX-INSTALL: Perform an apt-get -f install
  FIX-CONFIGURE: Perform a dpkg --configure -a

Version 0.3.15 2003/01/27

* New commands:
  LIST-ALL: List all known packages and brief description (Francis F. Steen)

* Changed commands:
  LIST now only lists installed packages.
  WHICH-PKG fixed for output from new debian server (Gordon Tyler)

Version 0.3.14 2002/11/09

* New command: DEPENDEES. List all packages which depend on the
  listed package.

* New command: ADD-CDROM to add CD-ROMS to apt-sources list.

* Include --force depends in FORCE.

* Add AUTO-DOWNLOAD, as suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel, and suitable
  as a nightly cron job to update and then download all upgraded
  packages. Thus when you come in to work in the morning, you can
  upgrade without a download!

Version 0.3.13 2002/06/29

* Tidy up some of the on-line documentation.

* Add a -f option to INSTALL where we can list a file name (Suggested
  by Andreas Fuchs)

* Allow a "-" with INSTALL to read the list of packages to install
  from standard input (Suggested by Andreas Fuchs)

* New command STATUS-SEARCH (synonym STATUS-MATCH) which will return
  the status of all packages with a given string in their name
  (Suggested by Bruno Randolf)

Version 0.3.12 2002/06/07

* The commands INSTALLR and INSTALLS are synonyms for RECOMMENDED and
  SUGGESTED.

* Add new command INSTALLRS to install package plus recommended and
  suggested pacakges.

* Ask for confirmation to install packages for these commands since
  apt-get won't ask. (Perhaps there is a way to get it to do so.)

Version 0.3.11

* Add SUGGESTED and RECOMMENDED. These check the given packages and 
  request that the package and its list of Suggested (or Recommended)
  packages also be installed. Base on suggestion from Stephen van Egmond.

Version 0.3.10

* Rework WhickPkg to continue if fping is not installed, as
  suggested by Chris Stork. Also print useful messages and
  also use dpkg -S to find local files.

Version 0.3.9

* New command RemoveOrphans (suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel)

* Make AVAILABLE a sysnonym for POLICY!

Version 0.3.8

* Small doc update: install particular versions with xlibs=4.1.0-7

* RECONFIGURE without argument runs gkdebconf
  Should now recommend gkdebconf

Version 0.3.7

* New commands: SHOW is a synonym for DETAIL.

* Bug fix: DETAIL's apt-cache show need not be root.

Version 0.3.6

* New commands: BUILD-DEPEND, LIST-COMMANDS

* Bug fixes: SOURCE and BUILD need not be root. BUILD use fakeroot.

Version 0.3.5

* Minor fixes to output.

Version 0.3.4

* New command RPM2DEB (and RPMTODEB) to convert a RedHat package into
  a Debian package. The resulting .deb can then be installed as usual.

* New command RPMINSTALL to directly install an rpm (after internally
  converting to a Debain package)

* All commands are now accepted as uppercase, lowercase, mixed case,
  and with any combination of "-" and "_".  Thus, if you like to say
  "wajig dist-upgrade" that will work, as will "wajig distupgrade" and
  "wajig DistUpgrade".  It was easy enough to do and does not seem to 
  have any downsides!

Version 0.3.3

* The NEW command is now a synonym for DESCRIBENEW.  This is more useful
  than just listing the version of the new packages! Use STATUS for that.

* Numerous spelling mistakes fixed thanks to Christian T. Steigies and
  James MacKinnon.

* Revert to using dselect update so that the appropriate dpkg tag files
  (i.e., /var/lib/dpkg/available) are updated also.

* Add a MOVE command: apt-move update

Version 0.3.2

* Bug fix Bug#119899 by adding LC_ALL to external commands that are run.

* Add DETAILNEW, NEWDETAIL, and NEWDESCRIBE.

* Revert to using apt-get update, not dselect update.

* Use fping rather than ping internally (suggested by Dirk).

Version 0.3.1

* Convert TOUPGRADE to use apt_pkg.

* Fix handling of SIGPIPE signals to fix Debian Bug#136439.

Version 0.3.0

* Begin rewriting portions to use the apt_pkg package (from python-apt).
  Thus, add python-apt to dependencies.  Also rewriting other file
  access code in python rather than external commands. Usually results
  in quicker responses. Decide that this warrants bumping up the version
  to the 0.3 serise.

* Converted to use apt_pkg, reading directly from tag file: DESCRIBE,
  DESCRIBENEW, NEW, NEWUPGRADES.

* New commands: DOWLOAD, FILEDOWNLOAD.

Version 0.2.13

* Add new DESCRIBENEW command that provides a one line description
  for each NEW package. This command was suggested by Dirk
  Eddelbuettel.

* Fix bug in FORCE and update FORCE to allow multiple package names.
  This bug was noted by Ole.Nielsen@anu.edu.au.

* Note that the UPDATE command uses dselect now rather than apt-get
  because apt-get does not update dpkg's idea of what's available.
  This comment was suggested by Adrian Phillips <adrianp@powertech.no>.

Version 0.2.12

* Fix up quoting and globbing issues.  wajig does not do any
  globbing and maintains the quoted'ness of all arguments.

* Add new POLICY command suggested by Christian Steigies
  <cts@debian.org>

* A few documentation fixes suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel
  <edd@debian.org>

Version 0.2.11

* INSTALL can now also take a URL (suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel)

* Change editor to sensible-editor (suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel)

* listinstalled can now have a single argument of a string to be in
  the package name

* New command daily-upgrade (suggested by Dirk) to combine update and
  dist-upgrade.

* force command has been generalised.  Allows multiple .debs and they
  need not be in the apt archive.

Version 0.2.10

* Minor doc update

Version 0.2.9

* Commands added:
	detail as suggested by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
	listinstalled
	fileinstall

* Allow install to take a list of .debs as suggested by Dirk
  Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
