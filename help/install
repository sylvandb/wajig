Install one or more packages or .deb files, or via a url.

$ wajig install <package name>
$ wajig install <deb filename>
$ wajig install http://example.com/<deb filename>

options:
  -n --noauth       install even if package is untrusted
  -y --yes          install without yes/no prompts; use with care!
  -r|--recommends   install Recommends (this is Debian default)
  -R|--norecommends do NOT install Recommends
     --dist         select which Debian suite to regard as default

Example:
$ wajig --noauth --yes --norecommends --dist experimental <package names>

The above command install the <package name> version from Experimental suite,
if available. It also disregard the situation where the package can't be
authenticated (e.g. the package cache is not updated or the keyring isn't
installed).  At the same don't prompt for confirmation, and also, don't install
packages Recommended by <package names>.

Note that unlike using 'dpkg -i', installing a deb file will also install
its dependencies.
