Description: simple and unified package management for Debian
 Wajig is a single commandline wrapper around apt, apt-cache, dpkg,
 /etc/init.d scripts and more, intended to be easy to use and providing 
 extensive documentation for all of its functions.

 With a suitable sudo(1) configuration, most (if not all) package installation
 as well as creation tasks can be done from a user shell. Wajig is also 
 suitable for general system administration.
